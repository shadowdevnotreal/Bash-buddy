## Features

- Automatic detection of the operating system and the appropriate package manager.
- Verification of required system commands' availability.
- Installation of missing packages upon user confirmation.
- Support for `apt`, `dnf`/`yum`, `brew`, and `pacman` package managers.
- Friendly, optional humor for users of all distributions, including Arch Linux.

## Overview of BashBuddy Scripts

BashBuddy comes with three key scripts:

1. **Main Skeleton Script**: The backbone of BashBuddy, providing the fundamental logic for detecting package managers, checking for command availability, and managing package installations.

2. **Simulation Sample Script**: A demonstration tool that simulates BashBuddy's functionality. It showcases how command-to-package mappings are defined and utilized, making it an excellent educational resource.

3. **Fully Working Sample Script**: An expanded version of the Main Skeleton Script, including comprehensive command-to-package mappings and real installation capabilities. This script is intended for users who want to see BashBuddy in action, managing actual dependencies.
